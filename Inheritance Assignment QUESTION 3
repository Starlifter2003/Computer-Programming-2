// QUESTIION 3(i)
//To manage and process student details for the given scenario, we can use inheritance to 
create a structure that represents the different types of courses and their stages. 
//This involves creating a "Student" base class with common information and subclasses for each
course type, such as "ICTStudent" or "LawStudent," that contain information unique to that
course.
//Inheritance helps us avoid repetition of code and makes it easier to handle
information for different types of students.



//QUESTION 3 (ii)
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// Define the Student class
class Student {
public:
    // Common attributes for all students
    string name;
    int age;
    string gender;
    string id_number;

    // Constructor to set common attributes
    Student(string name, int age, string gender, string id_number) {
        this->name = name;
        this->age = age;
        this->gender = gender;
        this->id_number = id_number;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create instances of Student
    Student s1("Jesus", 33, "Male", "ICT001");
    Student s3("Opondo", 25, "Male", "BUS001");

    // Output student information
    cout << "Student name: " << s1.name << endl;
    cout << "Age: " << s1.age << endl;
    cout << "Gender: " << s1.gender << endl;
    cout << "ID number: " << s1.id_number << endl << endl;

    cout << "Student name: " << s3.name << endl;
    cout << "Age: " << s3.age << endl;
    cout << "Gender: " << s3.gender << endl;
    cout << "ID number: " << s3.id_number << endl;

    return 0;
