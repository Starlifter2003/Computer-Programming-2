// QUESTIION 3(i)
//To manage and process student details for the given scenario, we can use inheritance to 
create a structure that represents the different types of courses and their stages. 
//This involves creating a "Student" base class with common information and subclasses for each
course type, such as "ICTStudent" or "LawStudent," that contain information unique to that
course.
//Inheritance helps us avoid repetition of code and makes it easier to handle
information for different types of students.
